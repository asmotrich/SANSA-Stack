## Description
SANSA Query is a library to perform SPARQL queries over RDF data using big data engines [Spark](https://spark.apache.org) and [Flink](https://flink.apache.org). It allows to query RDF data that resides both in HDFS and in a local file system. Queries are executed distributed and in parallel across Spark RDDs/DataFrames or Flink DataSets. Further, SANSA-Query can query non-RDF data stored in databases e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, MySQL or file format Parquet, using Spark.

For RDF data, SANSA uses vertical partitioning (VP) approach and is designed to support extensible partitioning of RDF data.
Instead of dealing with a single triple table (s, p, o), data is partitioned into multiple tables based on the used RDF predicates, RDF term types and literal datatypes.
The first column of these tables is always a string representing the subject.
The second column always represents the literal value as a Scala/Java datatype.
Tables for storing literals with language tags have an additional third string column for the language tag.
It supports [Sparqlify](https://github.com/AKSW/Sparqlify) or [Ontop](https://ontop-vkg.org/) as scalable SPARQL-to-SQL rewriters.

For heterogeneous data sources (data lake), SANSA uses virtual property tables (PT) partitioning, whereby data relevant to a query is loaded _on the fly_ into Spark DataFrames composed of attributes corresponding to the properties of the query. 

### SANSA Query SPARK - RDF
On SANSA Query Spark for RDF the method for partitioning an `RDD[Triple]` is located in [RdfPartitionUtilsSpark](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-RDF/blob/develop/sansa-rdf/sansa-rdf-spark/src/main/scala/net/sansa_stack/rdf/spark/partition/core/RdfPartitionUtilsSpark.scala). It uses an [RdfPartitioner](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-RDF/blob/develop/sansa-rdf/sansa-rdf-common/src/main/scala/net/sansa_stack/rdf/common/partition/core/RdfPartitioner.scala) which maps a Triple to a single [RdfPartitionStateDefault](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack/blob/develop/sansa-rdf/sansa-rdf-common/src/main/scala/net/sansa_stack/rdf/common/partition/core/RdfPartitionStateDefault.scala) instance.

* [RdfPartition](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-RDF/blob/develop/sansa-rdf-common/src/main/scala/net/sansa_stack/rdf/common/partition/core/RdfPartition.scala) - as the name suggests, represents a partition of the RDF data and defines two methods:
  * `matches(Triple): Boolean`: This method is used to test whether a triple fits into a partition.
  * `layout: TripleLayout`: This method returns the [TripleLayout](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-RDF/blob/develop/sansa-rdf/sansa-rdf-common/src/main/scala/net/sansa_stack/rdf/common/partition/layout/TripleLayout.scala) associated with the partition, as explained below.
  * Furthermore, RdfPartitions are expected to be serializable, and to define equals and hash code.
* TripleLayout instances are used to obtain framework-agnostic compact tabular representations of triples according to a partition. For this purpose it defines the two methods:
  * `fromTriple(triple: Triple): Product`: This method must, for a given triple, return its representation as a [Product](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.11.8/index.html#scala.Product) (this is the super class of all Scala tuples)
  * `schema: Type`: This method must return the exact Scala type of the objects returned by `fromTriple`, such as `typeOf[Tuple2[String, Double]]`. Hence, layouts are expected to only yield instances of one specific type.

See the [available layouts](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack/tree/develop/sansa-rdf/sansa-rdf-common/src/main/scala/net/sansa_stack/rdf/common/partition/layout) for details.

### SANSA Query SPARK - Heterogeneous Data Sources
SANSA Query Spark for heterogeneous data sources (data data) is composed of three main components:

* [Analyser](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-DataLake/tree/develop/sansa-datalake-spark/src/main/scala/net/sansa_stack/datalake/spark): it extracts SPARQL triple patters and groups them by subject, it also extracts any operation on subjects like filters, group by, order by, distinct, limit.
* Ÿê[Planner](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-DataLake/blob/develop/sansa-datalake-spark/src/main/scala/net/sansa_stack/datalake/spark/Planner.scala): it extracts joins between subject-based triple patter groups and generates join plan accordingly. The join order followed is left-deep. 
* [Mapper](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-DataLake/blob/develop/sansa-datalake-spark/src/main/scala/net/sansa_stack/datalake/spark/Mapper.scala): it access (RML) mappings and matches properties of a subject-based triples patter group against the attributes of individual data sources. If a match exists of every property of the triple pattern, the respective data source is declared _relavant_ and loaded into Spark DataFrame. The loading into DataFrame is performed using [Spark Connectors](https://spark-packages.org/).
* [Executor](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-DataLake/blob/develop/sansa-datalake-spark/src/main/scala/net/sansa_stack/datalake/spark/SparkExecutor.scala): it analyses SPARQL query and generates equivalent Spark SQL functions over DataFrames, for SELECT, WHERE, GROUP-BY, ORDER-BY, LIMIT. Connection between subject-based triple pattern groups are translated into JOINs between relevant Spark DataFrames. 

## Usage

### Requirements

We currently require a Spark 2.4.x with Scala 2.12 setup.

#### Release Version
Add the following Maven dependency to your project POM file:
```xml
<!-- SANSA Querying -->
<dependency>
   <groupId>net.sansa-stack</groupId>
   <artifactId>sansa-query-spark_2.12</artifactId>
   <version>$LATEST_RELEASE_VERSION$</version>
</dependency>
```

#### SNAPSHOT Version
While the release versions are available on Maven Central, latest SNAPSHOT versions have to be installed from source code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack.git
cd SANSA-Stack
mvn -am -DskipTests -pl :sansa-query-spark_2.12 clean install 
```
Alternatively, you can use the following Maven repository and addd it to your project POM file `repositories` section:
```xml
<repository>
   <id>maven.aksw.snapshots</id>
   <name>AKSW Snapshot Repository</name>
   <url>http://maven.aksw.org/archiva/repository/snapshots</url>
   <releases>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
   </releases>
   <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
   </snapshots>
</repository>
```
Then do the same as for the release version and add the dependency:
```xml
<!-- SANSA Querying -->
<dependency>
   <groupId>net.sansa-stack</groupId>
   <artifactId>sansa-query-spark_2.12</artifactId>
   <version>$LATEST_SNAPSHOT_VERSION$</version>
</dependency>
```
### Running from code
The following Scala code shows how to query an RDF file with SPARQL (be it a local file or a file residing in HDFS):

#### From file
```scala
import org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
import org.apache.jena.riot.Lang
import org.apache.jena.sparql.engine.binding.Binding
import net.sansa_stack.rdf.spark.io._
import net.sansa_stack.query.spark.ontop.QueryEngineFactoryOntop
import net.sansa_stack.query.spark.sparqlify.QueryEngineFactorySparqlify

// SparkSession is needed
val spark = SparkSession.builder
        .appName(s"Ontop SPARQL example")
        .config("spark.serializer", "org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer") // we need Kryo serialization enabled with some custom serializers
        .config("spark.kryo.registrator", String.join(
          ", ",
          "net.sansa_stack.rdf.spark.io.JenaKryoRegistrator",
          "net.sansa_stack.query.spark.ontop.OntopKryoRegistrator",
          "net.sansa_stack.query.spark.sparqlify.KryoRegistratorSparqlify"))
        .config("spark.sql.crossJoin.enabled", true) // needs to be enabled if your SPARQL query does make use of cartesian product Note: in Spark 3.x it's enabled by default
        .getOrCreate()

// load an RDD of triples (from an N-Triples file here)
val data = spark.rdf(Lang.NTRIPLES)("path/to/rdf.nt")

// create the main query engine
// we do provide two different SPARQL-to-SQL rewriter backends, Sparqlify and Ontop 
val queryEngineFactory = new QueryEngineFactoryOntop(spark) // Ontop
// or
val queryEngineFactory = new QueryEngineFactorySparqlify(spark) // Sparqlify

// create the query execution factory
val qef = queryEngineFactory.create(triples)

// our SPARQL query
val query = "..."

// create the query execution
val qe = qef.createQueryExecution(query)

// depending on the query type, finally execute the query
// a) SELECT query returns a ResultSetSpark which holdes an
//    RDD of bindings and the result variables
val result: ResultSetSpark = qe.execSelectSpark()
val resultBindings: RDD[Binding] = result.getBindings
val resultVars: Seq[Var] = result.getResultVars

// b) CONSTRUCT query returns an RDD of triples
val result: RDD[Triple] = qe.execConstructSpark()

// c) ASK query returns a boolean value
val result: Boolean = qe.execAsk()

// you may have noticed that for SELECT and CONSTRUCT queries we used methods ending on "Spark()"
// the reason here is that those method keep the results distributed, i.e. as an RDD
// For convenience, we do also support those methods without this behaviour, i.e. the results will be fetched to the driver
// and can be processed without the Spark pros and cons:

// a) SELECT query returns an Apache Jena ResultSet wrapping bindings and variables
val result: ResultSet = qe.execSelect()

// b) CONSTRUCT query and return an Apache Jena Model wrapping the triples as Statements
val result: Model = qe.execConstruct()
```
